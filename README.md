# Image-Caption-Generator
Have you ever wondered that a computer program can generate captions by looking at an image? 

Yes, we can. Have a look at this.


How important this problem is to real world scenarios?

We can create a product for the blind which will guide them travelling on the roads without the support of anyone else. 
We can do this by first converting the scene into text and then the text to voice. Both are now famous applications of Deep Learning. 

CCTV cameras are everywhere today, but along with viewing the world, if we can also generate relevant captions, 
then we can raise alarms as soon as there is some malicious activity going on somewhere. This could probably help reduce some crime and/or accidents.

Dataset:

There are many open source datasets available for this problem, like Flickr 8k (containing8k images), Flickr 30k (containing 30k images), MS COCO (containing 180k images), etc.
But for the purpose of this case study, I have used the Flickr 8k dataset which you can download by filling this link https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1713398
